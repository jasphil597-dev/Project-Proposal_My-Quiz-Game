#### Stretch Goals

• As a player, I would like a victory animation when I win the game, so that I feel good about my victory!
• As a player, I would like to hear an audible sound when I mark a game box so that I know my selection worked.
• As a player, I would like to play this game online so that I don't have to have my challenger sitting next to me.
• As a player who wants to dominate the quiz wizard, I want to become the ultimate Wikipedia so I can beat all of my opponents
